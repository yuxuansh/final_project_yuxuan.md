## Outline
Summary: I would like to show how the issue of food insecurity disproportionately affects Black communities during the pandemic.
Project structure: First, I will show the historical average food insecurity rate in the U.S. as a single line and then add several other lines showing the food insecurity rate for different races. Next, I would like to show a pie chart to present the proportion of total reported cases of food insecurity for different races during COVID-19 period (e.g. from July 2020 to July 2021). After the audiences get the impression that food insecurity has been disproportionately affecting Black communities, I will show some charts to explain the causes of this situation. For example, disproportionate Black people held jobs not only have a lower pay but are at the frontline, meaning that they are more likely to be laid off because of stay-at-home order and to contract COVID-19. Therefore, they have less liquid savings to respond to the pandemic. Besides, I would also like to show that how housing separation push Black people away from quality food resources. Finally, I may show that the assistancing resources that the government provided during the COVID-19 are disproportionately advantages White peaople.
