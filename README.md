## Outline
Summary: I would like to show how the issue of food insecurity disproportionately affects Black communities during the pandemic.
Project structure: First, I will show the historical average food insecurity rate in the U.S. as a single line and then add several other lines showing the food insecurity rate for different races. Next, I would like to show a pie chart to present the proportion of total reported cases of food insecurity for different races during COVID-19 period (e.g. from July 2020 to July 2021). After the audiences get the impression that food insecurity has been disproportionately affecting Black communities, I will show some charts to explain the causes of this situation. For example, disproportionate Black people held jobs not only have a lower pay but are at the frontline, meaning that they are more likely to be laid off because of stay-at-home order and to contract COVID-19. Therefore, they have less liquid savings to respond to the pandemic. Besides, I would also like to show that how housing separation push Black people away from quality food resources. Finally, I may show that the assistancing resources that the government provided during the COVID-19 are disproportionately advantages White peaople.

## The data
1. I will use the data on the website of U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/). It not only provides the data and statistics about food insecurity for different races but also shows a list of assistance programs. 
2. Move For Hunger is a organization that help people who are struggling in food shortage. It also provides plenty of data regarding races inequality on this issue (https://moveforhunger.org/hunger-racial-equity-issue).
3. The other organization called Breadfortheworld also provides insights about this issue (https://www.bread.org/library/racially-equitable-responses-hunger-during-covid-19-and-beyond).
4. Besides, there are also useful data from various research centers, for example, Food Research & Action Center
The data sources mentioned above could be used to draw charts. They solidly back up my topic and provide evidence.
## Method and medium
My plan has four steps:
1. Conceive my story. (It has been introduced in the outline)
2. Collect all the data needed and record the sources clearly. 
3. Use these data to draw various charts following my storyline and write a few sentence to describe each chart.
4. Create a story map using Esri Story Maps. Put all the charts into the map and adjust the animation, size, color etc.
Plus: If it is necessary, I might insert a short video into my story map, making my whole story more vivid.
